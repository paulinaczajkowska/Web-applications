## What is bouldering?
Bouldering is a form of rock climbing performed on small rock formations or artificial walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. Climbers rely on crash pads for protection and focus on short but challenging routes known as "problems".

## Equipment needed
- Climbing shoes
- Chalk and chalk bag
- Crash pads
- Brush for cleaning holds

## Basic techniques
1. **Footwork** - precise foot placements improve balance and efficiency
2. **Body positioning** - using body tension to stay on the wall
3. **Dynos** - jumping from one hold to another
4. **Crimping** - using fingertips to grip small holds
5. **Mantling** - pushing down on a hold to move upward

## Popular bouldering locations

## Bouldering grading systems
- **V-Scale (USA)**: ranges from V0 (easy) to V17+ (extreme)
